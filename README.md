  <summary>1. Introduction - Print Function </summary>

```py
# input() will get user input in console
# Then print() will print the word "Hello" and the user input
print("Hello + input("What is your name?"))
```

```py
# What is your name? Bob
# Hello Bob
```

```py
#This code prints the number of characters in a user's name.
print(len input ("What is your name?") ) )
```

```py
# What is your name? Bob
# 3
```

```py
name = input("What is your name?")
print(name)
```

```py
# What is your name? Mark
# Mark
```

```py
#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the band name generator.")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:
# https://band-name-generator-end.appbrewery.repl.run/
```

```py
# Welcome to the band name generator.
# Which city did you grow up in?
# Bristol
# What is the name of a pet?
# Rabbit
# Your band name could be  Bristol Rabbit
```

  <summary>2. Number Manipulation </summary>

Rounding Numbers:

```py
print(round(8 / 3, 2))
```

```py
# 2.67
```

Flooring Numbers:

```py
print(8 // 3)
```

```py
# 2
```

```py
result = 4 / 2
result /= 2
print(result)
```

```py
# 1.0
```

```py
score = 0
score += 1
print(score)

```

```py
# 1
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Using F Strings </summary>

```py
score = 0
print("your score is " + str(score))
```

```py
score = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
#f-String
print (f"your score is {score}")
```

```py
# your score is 0
```

```py
score = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
#f-String
print(f"your score is {score}, your height is {height}, you are winning is {isWinning}")
```

```py
# your score is 0, your height is 1.8, you are winning is True
```

```py
age = input("What is your current age? ")

rem = (90 - int(age))
d =  rem * 365
w = rem * 52
m = rem * 12

print(f"You have {d} days, {w} weeks, and {m} months left.")
```

```py
# What is your current age? 35
# You have 20075 days, 2860 weeks, and 660 months left.
```

Using the Format function:

```py
format(salesAmount, '.2f')
```

Using the Format Method:

```py
"{:.2f}".format(salesAmount)
```

```py
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill?\n$"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?\n"))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?\n"))
bill_with_tip = (tip/100+1) * bill
bill_for_each_person = "{:.2f}".format(bill_with_tip/people)
print(f'Each person should pay: ${bill_for_each_person}.')
```

```py
# Welcome to the tip calculator!
# What was the total bill?
# $150.00
# How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?
