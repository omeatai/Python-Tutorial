+INTRODUCTION

<details>
  <summary>1. Python Introduction</summary>

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br>

It is used for:<br>

web development (server-side),<br>
software development,<br>
mathematics,<br>
system scripting.<br>

What can Python do?<br>

Python can be used on a server to create web applications.<br>
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.<br>
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.<br>
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.<br>
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.<br>

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

```py
# Hello, World!
```

```py
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)
```

```py
# Python is awesome
```

```py
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)
```

```py
# Python is awesome
```

```py
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)
```

In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error.

```py
# Python is awesome
```

check Python version:

```bs
python --version
python -V
```

Run Python File:

```bs
python index.py
```

Run Python Shell:

```bs
python
```

```bs
Python 3.9.12 (main, Apr  5 2022, 01:53:17)
[Clang 12.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello")
Hello
>>> exit()
%
```

  <summary>2. Python Comments </summary>

Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.<br>

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment.<br>

Comments can be used to explain Python code.<br>

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.<br>

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.<br>

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line.<br>

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code.<br>

Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.<br>

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line.<br>

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it.<br>

```py
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
```

```py
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```

```py
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```

```py
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```

```py
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

<details>
  <summary>3. Python Variables </summary>

Python has no command for declaring a variable.<br>

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.<br>

Variable names are case-sensitive.<br>

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total\*volume). <br>

Rules for Python variables:<br>

-A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character<br>
-A variable name cannot start with a number<br>
-A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \* )<br>
-Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)<br>
Legal variable names:<br>

```py
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```

Camel Case = myVariableName<br>
Pascal Case = MyVariableName<br>
Snake Case = my_variable_name<br>

```py
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

```py
# 5
# John
```

```py
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

```py
# Sally
```

```py
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
```

Many Values to Multiple Variables-<br>
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:<br>

```py
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

```py
# Orange
# Banana
# Cherry
```

One Value to Multiple Variables-<br>
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:<br>

```py
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

```py
# Orange
# Orange
# Orange
```

Unpack a Collection-<br>
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc.<br>
Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.<br>

```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

```py
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```

  <summary>4. Python Type Casting </summary>

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

```py
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

```py
# 3
# 3
# 3.0
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. Python get Type </summary>

You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

```py
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```

```py
# <class 'int'>
# <class 'str'>
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. Python Global Variables </summary>

Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.<br>

Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.<br>

If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. <br>

The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.<br>

Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.<br>

To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.<br>

Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.<br>

```py
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()
```

```py
# Python is awesome
```

```py
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

```py
# Python is fantastic
# Python is awesome
```

```py
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

```py
# Python is fantastic
```

```py
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```

```py
# Python is fantastic
```

  <summary>7. Python DataTypes </summary>

In programming, data type is an important concept.<br>

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.<br>

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories.<br>

```bs
Text Type:	        str
Numeric Types:	        int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	        list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	        dict
Set Types:	        set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	        bool
Binary Types:	        bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	        NoneType
```

str:

```bs
x = "Hello World"	str
x = str("Hello World")	str
```

int, float, complex:

```bs
x = 20	        int
x = int(20)	int

x = 20.5	float
x = float(20.5)	float

x = 1j	        complex
x = complex(1j)	complex
```

list, tuple, range:

```bs
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	    list
x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	    list

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	    tuple
x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))tuple

x = range(6)	                            range
```

dict:

```bs
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	dict
x = dict(name="John", age=36)	dict
```

set, frozenset:

```bs
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	set
x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	set

x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	frozenset
```

bool:

```bs
x = True	bool
x = bool(5)	bool
```

bytes, bytearray, memoryview:

```bs
x = b"Hello"	bytes
x = bytes(5)	bytes

x = bytearray(5)	bytearray

x = memoryview(bytes(5))	memoryview
```

NoneType:

```bs
x = None	NoneType
```
