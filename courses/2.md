int
float
bool
str

# ()
# **
# * /

print(bin(5))
print(int('0b101', 2))
```

```py

# 5
```

# augmented assignment operator

```py
some_value = 5
some_value += 2
print(some_value)
```

```py
# 7
```

# Type conversion

```py
a = str(100)
b = int(a)
c = type(b)
print(c)
```

```py
# <class 'int'>
```

# Escape Sequence

```py
weather = "It\'s \"kind of\" sunny!"
print(weather)
```

```py
# It's "kind of" sunny!

# String Indexes with start-stop-step

```py
selfish = '01234567'
         # 01234567
# [start:stop:stepover]
print(selfish[0:8:1])
```

```py
# 01234567
```

# String Indexes with reverse option

## This is just an example

### This is the third example

```py
selfish = '01234567'
         # 01234567
# [start:stop:stepover]
